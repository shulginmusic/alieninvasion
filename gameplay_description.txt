In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

1. First Phase of Development:

Make a ship that moves right and left, and fires the bullets when the player presses the spacebar


Chapter 13 notes: 

- Examine code and determine if we need to refactor before
adding new functionality
- Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen
with appropriate spacing around it 
- Use spacing around the alien, and the overall screen size
to determine how many aliens can fit
Write a loop to create aliens to fill the upper portion of 
the screen 
- Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot down, an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the ground.
- If the whole fleet is shot down, create a new fleet. 
- If an alien hits the ship or the ground, we'll destroy the
ship and create a new fleet
-Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when the player has used up allotment of ships (e.g. 3 ships max allowed)
